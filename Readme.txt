This is a rough description of this project, also includes the daily change of this project.

We want learn the Boost Graph Library(BGL) through this project, so that we can use the BGL to do the further
computation and simulation of social network.

        Tools.cpp   contains the numberToSting utility so that we can transfer a number into a string object.
